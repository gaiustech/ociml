ref cursor implementation notes

- create statement handle oci_alloc_statement -> RefCursor of oci_statement
- bind it in as SQL type SQLT_RSET - pass statement callback function as context, cbf returns it as bufpp! 
- execute the query
- convert it into a meta_statement
- use it as normal
  
note quite that simple.. once have the oci_statement back, it needs to go through the sql_type=1 process to set up defines (see oraparse) - oracursor?

also new funcs to document, oraldalist, orasthlist, Oci_version (named to disambiguate from the server version)
