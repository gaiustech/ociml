OCI*ML 0.1

A simple Oracle API for OCaml. See blog for latest: http://gaiustech.wordpress.com 

*** If you are reading this on GitHub then the most-stable version will be in the .tgz ***

Developed on OCaml 3.11 and Oracle 10g and 11g on Debian Squeeze with GCC 4. 
Requires an Oracle client installation to build and at least instantclient to 
operate.  

Installation instructions:

# make
# make install
# ./ociml_sample # to run the sample code - read this too

Currently only the basic DML operations (parse, bind, execute and fetch) are 
available, in addition to connection and transaction control. This is sufficient 
to connect to Oracle and run any SQL statements, returning the result set to 
OCaml code for further processing. Additional features will be added as needed.

The library is structured as a thin wrapper around the OCI[1] library in C, on 
top of which is a higher level library patterned after OraTcl[2], as much as 
possible the commands do the same things, but usually with fewer options. The 
OCaml debug log can be enabled in the application, but C debugging requires 
#define'ing DEBUG and rebuilding. Debug messages from C are tagged {C}. It is
intended that a user of OCI*ML should never need to worry about the C layer.
