(* OCI*ML 0.1 *)

A simple Oracle API for OCaml. See blog for latest: http://gaiustech.wordpress.com 

*** If you are reading this on GitHub then the most-usable version will be in the 
    .tgz so just download that to get started ***

Developed on OCaml 3.11 and Oracle 10g and 11g on Debian Squeeze with GCC 4. 
Requires an Oracle client installation to build and at least instantclient to 
operate. Pure C so no issues with incompatible C++ libraries. 

Instructions:

# make

install ociml_test.sql and edit ociml_sample.ml with your login credentials.

# ./ociml_sample

Currently only the basic DML operations (parse, bind, execute and fetch) are 
available, in addition to connection and transaction control. This is sufficient 
to connect to Oracle and run any SQL statements, returning the result set to 
OCaml code for further processing. See the file ociml_sample.ml for further
details. It is assumed that you are basically familiar with Oracle and are
looking for a way to get "real work" done in OCaml as an alternative to say 
Perl.

The library is structured as a thin wrapper around the OCI[1] library in C, on 
top of which is a higher level library patterned after OraTcl[2], as much as 
possible the commands do the same things, but usually with fewer options. The 
OCaml debug log can be enabled in the application, but C debugging requires 
#define'ing DEBUG and rebuilding. Debug messages from C are tagged {C}. It is
intended that a user of OCI*ML should never need to worry about the C layer.
Debug messages go to STDERR so that can be redirected e.g. $ ./myapp 2>log

TODO (in no particular order):
	- AQ enqueue and (blocking) dequeue
	- LOBs
	- reconnection callback
	- RETURNING clause / OUT parameters for stored procedures
	- bulk operations
	- "make install" target that plays nicely with ocamlfind
